# Hardware

## OpenScad version
Poppy Ergo Jr was originally made by Jonathan Grizou (@jgrizou) with [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/).
This was inspired by the [Metabot project](https://github.com/Rhoban/Metabot/).

The OpenScad version of hardware is kept for memory and educational example of an OpenScad project, but it is __no longer maintained__.

## Onshape version
The up to date hardware version is made with [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/), which is a proprietary online CAD software, free to use for open source projects.
